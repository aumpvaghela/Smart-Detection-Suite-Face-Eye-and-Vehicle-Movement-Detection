# Smart-Detection-Suite-Face-Eye-and-Vehicle-Movement-Detection
This project uses OpenCV and Python for real-time detection of faces, eyes, and moving cars. Face and eye detection are performed using live webcam feed, while moving car detection uses a video file. Haar Cascade Classifiers are applied for detection. Ideal for beginners exploring computer vision techniques.
